# k8s-experiments

Welcome to the Kubernetes (k8s) Learning Journey.

On this journey, you'll learn to build a simple python application and then deploy it to Kubernetes.

Once deployed, you'll refactor the application and add supporting services to make the application produciton-ready.

This learning journey assumes a basic understanding of Python and the ability to use a Terminal.
