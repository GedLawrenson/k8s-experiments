# Getting Started

1) Install [docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) from the official Docker website. 
2) Open Docker Desktop and enable Kubernetes. This can take a few minutes to install. 
3) Open a terminal window and check that your Kubernetes cluster is up and running:
    ```
      kubectl cluster-info
    ```
    
    This should return something like:

    ```
    Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
    CoreDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
    ```

## What's Next?

You've now installed all of the pre-requisite software you need to get started. Good job! 

Next, open up Module 001 to read the README.
